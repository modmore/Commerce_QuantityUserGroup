QuantityUserGroup for Commerce
------------------------

This is an extension for modmore's [Commerce](https://modmore.com/commerce/). It provides a product price type that extends the core-provided Quantity price type with a user group filter, so you can definre usergroup-specific quantity prices.


As this is a pretty specific use case that adds a lot of power at the expense of a more complicated UI, we've opted to keep build it as an extension rather than the core.

Requirements:

- Commerce 1.3+
- PHP 7.4+
- ... other requirements ..

To use, install the package from the modmore package provider, and enable the module under Extras > Commerce > Configuration > Modules. After that, you can add the new price type to your products.
